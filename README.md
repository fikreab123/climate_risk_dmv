# Climate Risk Map for Bank Branches in DC, MD, and VA

This project looks at how climate risks affect bank branches in the DC, Maryland, and Virginia area.  
It includes cleaned data for each state, original climate datasets, a city-to-county lookup, and Jupyter notebooks showing the steps I used to prepare and analyze the data.

The goal is to map and understand climate risk levels for each branch, so we can see patterns and compare different locations.

## Planned Updates
- Tableau visualizations of climate risk patterns  
- SQL scripts for combining datasets  
- Final combined dataset for all branches
