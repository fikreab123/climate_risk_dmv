## ðŸŽ¯ Featured Project: Climate Risk Map for Bank Branches

**Overview:**  
Iâ€™m building an interactive data project that connects 1,750+ bank branch locations in Maryland, DC, and Virginia with FEMA climate risk data.
The goal is to uncover geographic patterns of environmental risk that could affect financial institutions and help guide future planning.

**My Work:**  
- Gathered and cleaned FDIC branch-level banking data for all three states
- Matched branches to counties and merged with FEMA climate risk scores
- Standardized all files for consistent formatting and analysis
- Built reproducible Jupyter notebooks to document the cleaning process
- Created a full SQL database and query library to combine and analyze data
- Exported key results to Excel for Tableau dashboards and risk summaries

**Tools:**  
Python (Pandas), SQL (SQLite), Jupyter Notebooks, Excel, Tableau, Flask (API)

Project Structure:
- sql/ â€“ Final database and SQL scripts for creating and querying the data
- outputs/ â€“ Exported Excel files used in Tableau and data summaries
- notebooks/ â€“ Cleaning notebooks for Maryland, DC, and Virginia
- raw/ â€“ Original unedited datasets

**Current Status:**  
Completed data cleaning, merging, and SQL integration across all three states.
Uploaded database, query files, and exports to GitHub.
Now building Tableau dashboards and planning a simple API for data access.
