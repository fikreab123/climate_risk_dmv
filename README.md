## ðŸŽ¯ Featured Project: Climate Risk Map for Bank Branches

**Overview:**  
I am developing an analysis and mapping project that connects bank branch locations in Maryland, DC, and Virginia with FEMA climate risk data.  
The goal is to reveal geographic patterns of risk that can help with future planning and decision-making.

**My Work:**  
- Gather and clean branch-level banking data for all three states  
- Standardize datasets and remove duplicates for accuracy  
- Link each branch to its county and match it with climate risk scores  
- Build reproducible Jupyter notebooks documenting the full process  
- Use SQL to combine datasets and Tableau to create interactive risk maps

**Tools:**  
Python (Pandas), SQL, Tableau, Jupyter Notebooks, Excel

**Current Status:**  
Clean datasets and detailed analysis notebooks are complete.  
I am now creating SQL integrations and Tableau visualizations to present insights.
